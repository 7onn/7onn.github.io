I'm a self-taught developer who went to tell one computer what to do (suddenly there were dozens of itâ€¦ and lately there have been hundreds) and is currently working to improve reliability in large-scaled distributed systems through automation alongside the pillars of observability (logs, metrics, traces).

Here are a few of my open-source [contributions](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3A7onn+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+is%3Apublic+is%3Amerged).

If you wish to send me something that only myself is able to read, encrypt your email with my [pgp key](/tom.asc) and send to <a href="mailto:devbytom@gmail.com">devbytom@gmail.com</a>.
