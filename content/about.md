I'm a self-taught software engineer whose career began at the age of 15. The last half decade has been largely focused on cloud infrastructure running distributed systems. 

Here are a few of my open-source [contributions](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3A7onn+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+is%3Apublic+is%3Amerged).

If you wish to send me something that only myself is able to read, encrypt some message into a file with my [pgp key](/tom.asc) and email it attached to <a href="mailto:devbytom@gmail.com">devbytom@gmail.com</a>.
