I'm a self-taught developer who went to tell one computer what to do (suddenly there were dozens of it… and lately there have been hundreds) and is currently working to improve reliability in large-scaled distributed systems through automation alongside the pillars of observability (logs, metrics, traces).

Here are a few of my open-source [contributions](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3A7onn+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+is%3Apublic+is%3Amerged).

If you wish to send me something that only myself is able to read, encrypt some message into a file with my [pgp key](/tom.asc) and email it attached to <a href="mailto:devbytom@gmail.com">devbytom@gmail.com</a>.
