Probably, &amp;gt;70% of the outages are due to changes in a live system.
Best practices in this domain are to use automation to accomplish the following:
Implementing progressive rollouts Quickly and accurately detecting problems Rolling back changes safely when problems arise This trio of practices effectively minimizes the aggregate number of users and operations exposed to harmful changes.</description></item><item><title>Emergency response</title><link>https://www.7onn.dev/post/emergency-response/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 09:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.7onn.dev/post/emergency-response/</guid><description>This following content is a transcript from Site Reliability Engineering with some, maybe none, personal adjustments.
Reliability is a function of mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR). The most relevant metric in evaluating the effectiveness of emergency response is how quickly the response team can bring the system back to health - that is, the MTTR.
Humans add latency. Even if a given system experiences more actual failures, a system that can avoid emergencies that require human intervention will have higher availability than a system that requires hands-on intervention.</description></item></channel></rss>
