Reliability is a function of mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR). The most relevant metric in evaluating the effectiveness of emergency response is how quickly the response team can bring the system back to health - that is, the MTTR.
Humans add latency. Even if a given system experiences more actual failures, a system that can avoid emergencies that require human intervention will have higher availability than a system that requires hands-on intervention.</description></item></channel></rss>
