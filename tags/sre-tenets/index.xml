Product development and SRE teams can enjoy a productive working relationship by eliminating the structural conflict in their respective goals. The structural conflict is between the pace of innovation and product stability. This conflict often is expressed indirectly. In SRE we bring this conflict to the fore, and then resolve it with the introduction of an error budget.</description></item><item><title>Ensuring a durable focus on engineering</title><link>https://7onn.github.io/post/ensuring-a-durable-focus-on-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 09:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://7onn.github.io/post/ensuring-a-durable-focus-on-engineering/</guid><description>This following content is a transcript from Site Reliability Engineering with some, maybe none, personal adjustments.
SREs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t dedicate more than 50% of their time in operational tasks.
That being said, their remaining time should be spent using their coding skills on project work. In practice, this is accomplished by monitoring the amount of operational work being done, and redirecting excess operational work to the product development teams: reassigning bugs and tickets to development managers, [re]integrating developers into on-call pager rotations, and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
