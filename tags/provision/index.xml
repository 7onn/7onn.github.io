Provisioning combines both change management and capacity planning and it must occur quickly and only when necessary, as capacity is expensive.
This exercise must also be done correctly or capacity doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when needed. Adding new capacity often involves spinning up a new instance or location, making significant modification to existing systems (configuration files, load balancers, networking), and validating that the new capacity performs and delivers correct results.</description></item><item><title>Demand forecasting and capacity planning</title><link>https://7onn.dev/post/demand-forecasting-and-capacity-planning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 09:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://7onn.dev/post/demand-forecasting-and-capacity-planning/</guid><description>This following content is a transcript from Site Reliability Engineering with some, maybe none, personal adjustments.
Demand forecasting and capacity planning can be viewed as ensuring that there is sufficient capacity and redundancy to serve projected future demand with the required availability. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing special about these concepts, except that a surprising number of services and teams don&amp;rsquo;t take the steps necessary to ensure that the required capacity is in place by the time it is needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
